## Executive Summary
Misight is a comprehensive HTTP RESTful API client-server system built to address real-world challenges in mining data management. The server, developed in Spring Boot, exposes RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on environmental and safety data, while the Java-based client interfaces with the server using `RestTemplate` for seamless data management.

## Business Problem Analysis
