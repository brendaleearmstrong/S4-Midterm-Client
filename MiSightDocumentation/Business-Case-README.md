# MiSight: Data Management System - Business Case & Overview

## Executive Summary

Drawing from my experience as Principal Advisor of Communications at a major iron ore mining operation in Labrador, where I was responsible for collaborating with environmental, safety, and operations teams to compile internal and external reports, I witnessed firsthand the daily struggles of managing critical operational data. The countless hours spent manually collecting environmental data, coordinating safety reports, and responding to community concerns about dust levels highlighted a critical industry need. 

Through my transition to software development at Keyin College, I recognized the opportunity to transform these challenges into a digital solution. MiSight was born from this unique perspective, designed to transform fragmented data collection into a streamlined, efficient system that serves all stakeholders.



## Business Problem Analysis
### Key Challenges
1. **Data Collection Inefficiencies**: Manual data collection leads to delays and inconsistencies.
2. **Environmental Monitoring Gaps**: Lack of real-time data on pollutants and dust levels.
3. **Safety Management Issues**: Fragmented incident reporting.
4. **Stakeholder Communication Barriers**: Limited access to environmental data.

### Mining operations currently rely on:
- Paper-based environmental monitoring logs
- Spreadsheet-based safety incident tracking
- Manual data compilation for reports
- Email-based stakeholder communications
- Disconnected data storage systems

## Proposed Solution
Misight provides digitalized data collection, role-based access control, and automated reporting. This system centralizes data management, helping mining operations streamline environmental monitoring and safety tracking.

## Core Features & Benefits
1. **Environmental Monitoring**:
   - Real-time dust tracking and threshold alerts.
2. **Safety Management**:
   - Standardized incident reporting and trend analysis.
3. **Stakeholder Engagement**:
   - Public dashboards for transparency.

## Impact Analysis
### Before Misight
- Manual data collection, delayed reporting, limited transparency.

### After Misight
- Automated data collection, real-time reporting, and improved stakeholder access.

## MVP Scope
- **Current Capabilities**: Digital records, basic reporting, role-based access.
- **Next Steps**: Expansion into Microsoft PowerBI integration for enhanced reporting and visualization and , AI/ML predictive analytics.
