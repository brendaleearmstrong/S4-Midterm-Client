# MiSight: Future Development Roadmap

## Current Implementation
### Phase 1: Initial System Digitalization
- **Data Entry**: Digital records for environmental and safety data.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Tracks pollutant levels.
- **Safety Incident Tracking**: Logs near-misses and incidents.
- **Basic Reporting**: Generates compliance and safety reports.

## Future Development Phases

### Phase 2: Production Integration
Integrating production metrics will add operational data:
```json
{
    "productionData": {
        "mineArea": "string",
        "shiftProduction": {
            "targetTonnage": "double",
            "actualTonnage": "double",
            "grade": "double"
        }
    }
}
```

### Phase 3: AI/ML Integration and MVP Deployment
**Predictive Analytics**:
- Dust level and safety incident forecasting.
  
### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- **Production Optimization**: Real-time production control.
- **Integrated Reporting**: ESG metrics and compliance.

## Implementation Strategy
1. **Data Foundation**: Phase 1 data collection and user management.
2. **Production Integration**: Schema updates for production data.
3. **AI/ML Development**: Data pipelines and machine learning models.
